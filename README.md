The **inkscapeFiles** directory contains all the files and instructions needed to laser cut a frame for the self-balancing bot.

All the files needed for the pcb (including gerber files) are located in **kicadFiles**.

The R1 resistor value should be 2K ohms, whilst for R2 it's 1k ohms.

The Arduino code is a modified version of that developed by [http://www.klikrobotics.com](http://www.klikrobotics.com) and the original github repository is at [https://github.com/garethnisbet/T-BOTS](https://github.com/garethnisbet/T-BOTS). The code was branched off in Oct 2018 and so is quite out of date but works!
